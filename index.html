									<h3>Blogger's Block</h3>
<p>If there’s such a thing as bloggers block, it’s quite possible I’ve caught it. Either that or just plain laziness. The need to write something, anything, is there, but the mind turns up blank when attempting to manifest a jumble of occurrences and happenchance onto paper. So, I thoughts, let us conquer this bloggers block. Start by exploring something simple, and then move on to something even simpler.
<p><strong>Opoulos Conundrum</strong>
<p>First, we’ll begin with the Opoulos conundrum. George Stroumboulopoulos, George Stephanopoulos, and George Christopoulos. Notice anything similar between these popular TV hosts names? Yep, you may have guessed it, but the rest of it is all Greek to me. The similarity is that they all contain ‘George’ and ‘Opoulos’, which at first glance seems kind of odd. How is it that three broadcasters all share the same first names, and almost identical last names?
									<footer class="controls">
										<a href="#" class="button">continue...</a>
									</footer>
<!--<p>To resolve this conundrum, I decided to do some multi-layered research (Google, then Wikipedia). Here’s what I uncovered: It seems that the word Opoulos comes from a region in Greece called the Peloponnesos, which is ruled by a mighty hero named Pelops. It also appears that Opoulos is more a suffix for the surnames in that area, meaning "descendent of". So this is all coming together now. But it still doesn’t really explain why everyone’s named George, or where this Pelops character comes into play, and how anyone from there turns into a television star.
<p><strong>Brooks to Rivers, What's Bigger?</strong>
<p>Our second trek will take us into the flowing tides of streams, brooks, creeks and rivers. These moving bodies of water can be discovered within many areas of our vast land, here in Canada. You may have stumbled upon them in conservation parks, the countryside, the Northland, or even in your own backyard. Some of them seem only a slow trickle, meandering along our forest beds, while others rush quickly along, inviting one to partake in rod and paddle. 
<p>Though finding these waters bring a sense of peace and serenity, they can lull the mind to the real quandary. Have you found a brook? Is it a stream? Perhaps a river, or wait, it has to be a creek! To solve this dilemma, I hit up Google again, and then prepared this definitive guide to recognizing the difference between these types of waters: When you come across a brook, it is small. Happen upon a creek, it is larger, but smaller than a river. Find yourself a river, you will probably know, cause it is the largest. Now, if it is a stream that you are wading in, then that could be any of the other three, or not. This is because a stream is described as ‘any flowing water within a bed and banks’.</p>
<p>So there it is. This blogger’s block of mine has been freed. A topic or two, involving this and that, one thing or another, the inner verse has been unleashed to online prose.</p>
